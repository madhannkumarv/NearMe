            Likely a smaller settlement within the Ranipet district, close to the historical town of Arcot.
            This village may focus on agriculture as its primary livelihood, supported by the fertile lands of the Palar River basin.
            Its proximity to Arcot suggests cultural and historical influences from the Nawabs of Arcot era.
