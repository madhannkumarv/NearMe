            Tajpura is a village near Arcot in the Ranipet district of Tamil Nadu, India. It is one of the small settlements in the region, known for its rural charm and historical connections, particularly in areas with Mughal or Nawab influences, as Arcot was historically the seat of the Nawabs of the Carnatic.
            The name "Tajpura" suggests a possible connection to Persian or Mughal influences, as "Taj" is a Persian word meaning "crown."
            It could have been a settlement established or influenced during the era of the Nawabs of Arcot, who were known for their Persian and Mughal ties.
